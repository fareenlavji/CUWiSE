For the 2019 Ecole Polytechnique Montreal Massacre Memorial, CU-WISE embarked on creating calendars featuring leading ladies in STEM.
I took up organizing, designing, and production of the calendars.
I designed the calendars to serve as motivators for individuals experiencing hurdles in their careers and to implement CU-WISE's new colour scheme.
The calendars were used to raise funds for the White Ribbon Campaign.
